            "\n",
            "5. **Add Rice and Water:** Add the soaked basmati rice and water (or chicken broth) to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is almost cooked but still slightly firm.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Layer (Dum Method - for best results):**  This step is crucial for authentic biryani.  If using a pot with a tight-fitting lid, you can proceed directly to step 7.  Otherwise, use a heatproof dish and layer the ingredients:\n",
            "    * Spread half of the cooked rice evenly over the bottom of the pot/dish.\n",
            "    * Spread half of the chicken mixture over the rice.\n",

            "    * Drizzle ghee or oil over the top layer (optional).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Dum (Steam):** Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cook for 15-20 minutes, allowing the biryani to steam.  This \"dum\" method creates a tender and flavorful biryani.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Rest and Serve:** Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10-15 minutes before gently fluffing it with a fork. Garnish with fresh cilantro and mint. Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) and your favorite side dishes.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Vegetarian Biryani:** Replace chicken with vegetables like potatoes, peas, carrots, and cauliflower.\n",
            "* **Lamb Biryani:** Substitute chicken with lamb, adjusting cooking time accordingly.\n",
            "* **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of chili powder to your preference.\n",
            "* **Rice Type:** Use high-quality basmati rice for best results.\n",
            "* **Soaking Rice:** Soaking the rice is essential for even cooking.\n",
            "* **Don't Overmix:** Avoid overmixing the rice and chicken once layered to prevent the rice from becoming mushy.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Enjoy your homemade biryani!  Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't exactly restaurant-quality.  Experiment with different spices and ingredients to find your own perfect recipe.\n"

Although the president of India is the constitutional, nominal, and ceremonial head of state, in practice and ordinarily, the executive authority is vested in the prime minister and their chosen Council of Ministers. The prime minister is the leader elected by the party with a majority in the lower house of the Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, which is the main legislative body in the Republic of India. The prime minister and their cabinet are at all times responsible to the Lok Sabha. The prime minister can be a member of the Lok Sabha or of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. The prime minister ranks third in the order of precedence.\n",

The prime minister is the presiding member of the Council of Ministers of the Union government. The prime minister unilaterally controls the selection and dismissal of members of the council; and allocation of posts to members within the government. This council, which is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha as per Article 75(3), assists the president regarding the operations under the latter's powers; however, by the virtue of Article 74 of the Constitution, such 'aid and advice' tendered by the council is binding.\n",
            "Since 1947, India has had 14 prime ministers. Jawaharlal Nehru was India's first prime minister, serving as prime minister of the Dominion of India from 15 August 1947 until 26 January 1950, and thereafter of the Republic of India until his death in May 1964. (India conducted its first post-independence general elections in 1952). Earlier, Nehru had served as prime minister of the Interim Government of India during the British Raj from 2 September 1946 until 14 August 1947, his party, the Indian National Congress having won the 1946 Indian provincial elections. Nehru was succeeded by Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose 1 year 7-month term ended in his death in Tashkent, then in the USSR, where he had signed the Tashkent Declaration between India and Pakistan. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, succeeded Shastri in 1966 to become the country's first female prime minister. Eleven years later, her party, the Indian National Congress, lost the 1977 Indian general election to the Janata Party, whose leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister. After Desai resigned in 1979, his former associate Charan Singh briefly held office until the Congress won the 1980 Indian general election and Indira Gandhi returned as prime minister.
