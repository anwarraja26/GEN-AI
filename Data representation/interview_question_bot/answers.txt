Summary: \nThis study presents the first large-scale empirical investigation of quantum kernels for real-\nworld prediction tasks using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The researchers compared \nquantum support vector machines (QSVM) with classical SVMs using a dataset  focused \non predicting six-month persistence of rheumatoid arthritis patients on biologic therapies. \nBy constructing a 12 -point configuration space with different feature and sample sizes, \nthey assessed empirical quantum advantage (EQA) using performance metrics like F1 \nscore and balanced accuracy.  \n \nInterestingly, while classical tools remained robust in most cases, quantum kernels showed \nadvantage in certain hard classification instances, particularly in scenarios with small \ndatasets and a high feature-to-sample ratio. The authors introduced the Terrain Ruggedness \nIndex (PTRI) to assess complexity in the configuration space and identify areas more likely \nto yield quantum advantage.  \n \nDespite noise and limited resources, the team successfully executed 24 configurations onboth simulated and real quantum processors (IBM’s ibmq_dublin). They utilized the \nZZFeatureMap to encode data and custom kernel matrices, applying regularization \ntechniques to optimize outcomes.
